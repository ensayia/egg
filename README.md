# egg - minimal node style note taking system

egg requires the LOVE framework, available on most operating systems

### why

I desperately wanted a program for simple note taking. Most options out
there are either overly complicated for my needs or have ridiculous
depenency requirements.

egg is guided by the idea of simplicity and minimalism. If you're looking
for something with all the bells and whistles there are plenty of good
options out there (check out [cherrytree](https://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/)) for a great full-featured option!
