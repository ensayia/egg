# egg - minimal node organized note taking program

egg requires the LOVE framework, available on most operating systems

## why

I desperately wanted a program for simple note taking. Most options out there are either overly complicated for my needs or have silly depenency requirements.

egg is guided by the idea of simplicity and minimalism. If you're looking for something with all the bells and whistles there are plenty of good options out there (check out [cherrytree](https://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/)) for a solid full-featured option

## questions

- will egg get (insert feature)?
Probably not. egg is specifically lacking features in order to promote simplicity and a distraction free expereience.
